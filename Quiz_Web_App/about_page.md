## About

#### Who is this website for?
This website is targeted mainly at people who want a quick way of refreshing important concepts related to Indian and World geography via a visual medium. However, many of us are visual learners and are able to connect things better when we see them. So anyone who wants to have a go at a map is welcome here.

#### Where did the idea come from?
As a student of Geography optional, we have to learn and internalise World and India maps. There was no website that collated interactive maps relevant for CSE aspirants. In order to learn, I created this repository. My husband helped me scale it for use by other competitive exam aspirants like me. 

#### Will you add more content?
Yes, and I am taking suggestions! Reach out to me on Twitter or Linkedin if you want to chat. 

#### Who are you anyway?
I am a financial analyst by day and a hobby coder. You can drop me a DM on Twitter to connect.

#### Is this free?
Yes, for now. Although I will try to look at some monetization model if the traffic exceeds a number where it is difficult for me to suppport.
